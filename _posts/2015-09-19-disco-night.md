I received this book as a gift last year when it came out and was moved to take it out again due to the recent anniversary of 9/11.

*Disco Night Sept 11*, a book of photographs and writing by Peter Van Agtmael, offers a vivid perspective of the American invasion of Afghanistan.

As a group, Van Agtmael's pictures depict a more holistic view of soldiers' experiences, along with glimpses of the impact of war on others, including the photographer himself. In his thoroughness, Van Agtmael is able to respectfully record pain and question its circumstances without being overtly political. The images are aesthetically straightforward but they are not detached; they suggest a photographer whose eyes are empathetic though they remain wide open.

Short texts, between one sentence and one page long, accompany the photographs. Most are written by the photographer, but there are also some (particularly interesting) excerpts from interviews (with veterans, or Van Agtmael's own father). Much of the writing includes the first person, which somehow makes it feel more real than the more detached language of news.

The pictures in this book are difficult to look away from or forget, and the written passages are simply wrenching. They describe the war and the consequences faced by American participants (most of whom are quite young) and their families. They also paint an especially bleak picture with regard to the effect of the United States' actions on the nations that were invaded after 9/11.

Van Agtmael seems to seek, if not good a reason for this suffering, then a keen record of it that implores us to ask: Why? What was this all for?
