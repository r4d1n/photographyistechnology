My name is Jared. I am an artist and web developer currently located in Oakland, CA.
I have loved taking pictures since I was a kid and, at some point, started taking it
sort of seriously. I care about photography; I enjoy thinking about it and, given the virtual omnipresence of photographs and cameras in the society in which I live, feel that it is important to do so in a nuanced way.

This blog is an ongoing project of mine, a place to hash out
developing ideas about the nature of technologically enabled art in our futuristic society. Since this is a more or less personal repository for my own writing, I try not to hold myself too rigidly to a single interpretation of this theme. Rather, my hope is that in collecting here thoughts and observations that are intuitively if not explicitly related, I will see later on how it all coheres.
