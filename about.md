This blog is a place for me to hash out ideas about technology and art in our futuristic society.

Since this is a more or less personal repository for my own writing, I try not to hold myself too rigidly to a single interpretation of this theme. Rather, my hope is that in collecting here some observations that are intuitively if not explicitly related, I can develop my thoughts over time and learn how they cohere.
