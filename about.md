My name is Jared. I am an artist and web developer currently located in Oakland, CA.
I have loved taking pictures since I was a kid and, at some point, started taking it
sort of seriously. This blog is an ongoing project of mine where I try to hash out my own
developing ideas about the nature of technologically dependent art in our futuristic society.
