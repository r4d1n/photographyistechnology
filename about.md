This blog is a place for me to hash out ideas about technology and art in our futuristic society.

Since this is basically a personal repository for my own writing, I try not to hold myself too rigidly to a single interpretation of this theme.
My hope is that in collecting observations that are intuitively if not explicitly related, I can develop my thoughts over time and see what coheres later on.
