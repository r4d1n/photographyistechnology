This blog is an ongoing project of mine, a place to hash out
developing ideas about the nature of technologically enabled art in our futuristic society.

Since this is a more or less personal repository for my own writing, I try not to hold myself too rigidly to a single interpretation of this theme. Rather, my hope is that in collecting here thoughts and observations that are intuitively if not explicitly related, I will see later on how it all coheres.
