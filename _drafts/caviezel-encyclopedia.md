I really like photobooks but am not a serious collector; I tend to buy only one or two a year and sometimes receive others as gifts in December. This being the case, I try to make it count with the books that I do purchase. I look for work that I will be able to keep coming back to and thinking about, that seems especially substantial and worth owning either because it is definitive and timeless, because it is truly cutting edge, or (ideally) both. Since a lot of photobooks sell out and then become prohibitively expensive, this decision is often quick and more intuitive more than anything else.

*The Encyclopedia of Kurt Caviezel* got me excited enough when I read about it on [Collector Daily](https://collectordaily.com/kurt-caviezel-the-encyclopedia-of-kurt-caviezel/) that I
ordered a copy right away.

The project is comprised of selected screenshots taken from an archive that the artist collected from around 15000 webcams over the course of 15 years. These have been organized into encyclopedic categories based on matching content (Pool, Bird, Kiss) or formal features (Black Sun, Error). Sometimes a single image stands out as particularly curious, but a lot of the work's impact has more to do with repetition and the recognition of patterns between pictures. The discovery of so much sameness out of such a vast source of imagery is amazing; looking through the book, I am wowed and tickled by this collection of ordinary frames wryly laid out in categories which are sometimes obvious and mundane, others clever and surprising.

This work is a little bit absurd, but so is a lot of the most thoughtful art out there. Especially when trying to approach themes like the proliferation of images online, or the impact of the network on our experience of times and places, a sense of humor keeps us grounded and helps us begin to examine interesting new phenomena that are now abstract aspects of everyday life.

There is an essay at the beginning of the book by Joachim Schmidt, who also makes great work with archival images, and he makes a key point about what distinguishes this work from others where found pictures are sequenced in new contexts and makes it particularly interesting to me as I continue to learn about technology and think about how artists can engage with a software-oriented, data-saturated society.

<blockquote>
"Through years of camera surveillance the artist has compiled a virtually unreal amount of images, which have all been harvested from webcams. The quantity of images is of crucial import here, because quanitity (as is the case with many collections of things) at some point turns into quality. Only abundance enables the detection of recurring patterns. May the single image be just funny or banal or vacuous, in a series of similar ones it becomes a building block of knowledge."
</blockquote>

More traditional photographic methods (like just taking lots of pictures) can also be approached as processes of gathering data in the form of images. Even in the darkroom we talk about how a larger negative will hold more information than 35mm film, and dodge and burn to ensure that what was captured is rendered fully in every area of the print. But this book entails a search for details at a different scale from what we are accustomed to seeing in art or documentary pictures that guide us to focus on unique scenes that may or may not be sequenced together for context or a particular group effect. As Schmidt points out, each image in this book is here less because of its noteworthiness as a picture than for its reduced import as a single piece of data among many. At the same time, the images themselves are still more specifically detailed than scatter-plotted dots: they aren't visually uniform, and we can examine each one closely, on its own.
