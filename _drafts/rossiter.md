Never had a burning desire to shoot a particular subject, just loved photography. 

Archival aspect, conservation, a collector
Knowledge of paper types, chemistry, history of photography through its technology, material artifacts. A physical record.  

A random element to what she finds  other prints are more intentional, dipping to create shapes and shading vs finding mold, degradation. 

A physical link to the past. Think about the darkroom, isolated, and here is an object touched by another doing the same sort of work. 

Notes luck of finding paper early on that reacted in interesting ways.
