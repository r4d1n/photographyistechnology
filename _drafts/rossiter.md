Last week I went to see Alison Rossiter speak at CCA.
I was not familiar with her work beforehand, but she ended up giving what turned out to be one of the better artist talks I have been to in a while, at least personally, in terms of how much of what she said resonated with me and the degree to which I was inspired to go make work of my own afterward.

She was very down to earth. She began with her own biography leading up to the work, from taking a photography class in Banff as a teenager (though she originally hails from Mississippi) through time spent studying photography at Rochester Institute of Technology and years as a young person in Montreal and New York, then on to New Jersey where, (I think) she still resides and works in a darkroom at home. She showed some color still lifes from her time in Montreal, saying she made portraits of everything in her apartment because her French was so bad that she was afraid to go out.
Then later still lifes of feminine beauty tools, pictures of horses in the New Jersey countryside, and eventually a photogram of a bottle of Windex that set the stage for her current work, which is made without a camera.

Rossiter's art is made by gathering and developing expired photo paper. Sometimes she involves herself more in the result by exposing the paper, or by dipping and pouring so that some areas are developed before others, but it seems that collecting the paper is as important to the process as using it in the darkroom.

She said she never had a burning desire to shoot a particular subject, but she always loved photography. Her enthusiasm for the medium and its history was apparent in the way she spoke, especially when she got into stories about particular packs of paper she had found.

Having spent a fair amount of time alone in the lab, I found it especially poignant when she spoke of the individual who left fingerprints on a piece of paper eighty years before she found it, and put it back in the box for whatever reason. That she regularly finds cut up test strips in the boxes (and sometimes uses them for her own work, though she said she has decided on a rule against cutting the paper herself) is also a touching or haunting, depending on how you think about it, connection to another person across time via these photographic artifacts.
The physical objects have primacy here, but I think there is something deeply photographic about this way of making work and thinking about the world.

Archival aspect, conservation, a collector
Knowledge of paper types, chemistry, history of photography through its technology, material artifacts. A physical record.  

A random element to what she finds  other prints are more intentional, dipping to create shapes and shading vs finding mold, degradation.

A physical link to the past. Think about the darkroom, isolated, and here is an object touched by another doing the same sort of work.

Notes luck of finding paper early on that reacted in interesting ways.
