The power of photography lies in the power it gives us to tear our observations out of context. That the camera can abstract parts of the world into portable pictures is a miraculous and its extremely widespread adoption signals a practically prosthetic enhancement to humans eyes and memory. But aside from that, and preceding the ease with which we can today transmit pictures in messages, there was the development of photographic rhetoric. If images can be produced, found, and shuffled around as easily as words and phrases, then it follows that visual styles, tones, even languages should develop as well. Pictures are like quotes, often chosen as carefully as the lines of a sonnet. 
 
This is why appropriation is such a natural approach to working with photographs. Once you're using a machine to make images anyway, why does it matter who triggered it, or if you were even around at all when it was done?

This obviously doesn't apply to everyone. Some work indeed depends on the artist's presence and very direct involvement in making pictures. It's a matter of tools, styles, and intuitive preferences. 

Photographs are like quotes that we take out of our environments so we can ponder them more closely later, in a different light (pun sort of intended). We can stare at the object of our interest for as long as we want, and show others, that they may stare as well. But a photograph is only an approximation or its subject, an abstraction we can contemplate. 

Captions explain pictures to us by pinning them to a particular context. Likewise, placing images in sequence without words influences how they are received. The widespread use of both techniques speaks to the unruliness of individual images, which turn out to be much less concrete than the camera's precision makes them seem.
