The power of photography lies in the power it gives us to tear our observations out of context. That the camera can abstract parts of the world into portable pictures is a miraculous and its extremely widespread adoption signals a practically prosthetic enhancement to humans eyes and memory. But aside from that, and preceding the ease with which we can today transmit pictures in messages, there was the development of photographic rhetoric. If images can be produced, found, and shuffled around as easily as words and phrases, then it follows that visual styles, tones, even languages should develop as well. Pictures are like quotes, often chosen as carefully as the lines of a sonnet.

This is why appropriation is such a natural approach to working with photographs. Once you're using a machine to make images anyway, why does it matter who triggered it, or if you were even around at all when it was done?

Photographs are like quotes that we take out of our environments so we can ponder them more closely later, in a different light (pun sort of intended). We can stare at the object of our interest for as long as we want, and show others, that they may stare as well. But a photograph is only an approximation or its subject, an abstraction we can contemplate.

Captions explain pictures to us by pinning them to a particular context. Likewise, placing images in sequence without words influences how they are received. The widespread use of both techniques speaks to the unruliness of individual images, which turn out to be much less concrete than the camera's precision makes them seem.

// Arbus, Soth images

*War Is Beautiful* is a book all of quotes, like Walter Benjamin wrote about. David Shields collected and organized photographs from the New York Times and framed them with written quotations. The pictures are presented in new sequences without the rest of the day's news around them, though full spreads are reprinted on the inside of the book. They are used like phrases and paragraphs cited from other works to develop a polemical point about the Grey Lady glorifying conflict abroad.
It's a meta project, not about war itself, or these particular conflicts, but about the way that contemporary conflicts are generally represented by this particular publication.

What does all of this have to do with programming? I guess the connection dawned on me as I was reading Andrew Hodge's biography of Alan Turing on my way to work.
One passage, which characterizes Turing's initial conception of general purpose computers as "a bridge, a connection between abstract symbols and the physical world," struck me as an entrance into an interesting way of thinking about photographs. Not so much symbols, but a bridge, perhaps, between the physical world and its reflection in a portable and in some ways, yes, more *abstract* realm.

What do we mean when we talk about abstraction?
