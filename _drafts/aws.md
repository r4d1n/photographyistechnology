Amazon is a high profile company with a lot of customers, that faces criticism (from critical folks) for its labor politics (but not as much as Uber). This was highlighted most recently in a New York Times piece about the experiences of some white collar employees in Seattle, though by all accounts working in the warehouse is more brutal.
However, as far as I can tell, most people who don't work in technology are unaware of Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing infrastructure, which ([according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)) was productized as a source of additional revenue after being designed and built initially to support Amazon's retail operations.
Apparently (again, skimming the Wikipedia) customers include not only Pinterest and Netflix, but also NASA and the CIA.

The platform and its many services are actually kind of amazing and enable individuals to do incredible things (of course, so long as those things require on-demand computing power, vast networking capabilities, and/or highly available storage). So when I had the opportunity to attend a training session at the Amazon Web Services "Pop Up Loft" in San Francisco, I was eager to attend both for technical reasons and because the company is an intriguing agent in the unfolding present day.
I have purchased a wide variety of goods from Amazon, but the company runs no physical store. The closest thing there is to going "to" Amazon, aside from infiltrating an office, would be browsing to their website. I was curious to see what this space would be like, and excited to learn how to make use of the cloud.

One of my coworkers who is a big fan of AWS likes to say that it makes developers into a one person army. It is indeed a powerful feeling to spin up and destroy virtual servers en masse, to set rules that will do so automatically, to quickly connect to various types of basically bottomless storage, and to make it all accessible from anywhere in the world. Basically, things that would have required massive expense and the commissioning of physical computers (perhaps even buildings) ten years ago.

[This lecture by Douglas Crockford](https://youtu.be/JxAXlJEmNMg) contains a great history of the development of personal computers and the web that describes various iterations of computers such as single processors requiring highly specialized facilities to run, as well as the use of teletype terminals from which one could utilize a mainframe computer remotely, paying to use its computing power when necessary without owning the entire machine.

In a way, the rise of cloud computing seems like a shift to a paradigm that parallels that of terminals and mainframes. Nowadays, many people use smaller, less powerful computers like smartphones and tablets, not just alongside but instead of laptops or desktop PCs.
Some applications on smartphones are mainly used on the device itself, like games or photo editors, but for the most part such devices are typically used to access a variety of web services, like email, social media, file storage, banking, shopping, etc. The phone runs a client app (or is pointed at a website) that communicates over the network with a central system where the main computation happens and information is stored.
I think the similarity to a mainframe with a teletype terminal is most apparent in Chromebooks, which have are designed to be used almost exclusively with and Internet connection, since the use of cloud storage and applications like Google Docs integrated directly into their operating systems, but the idea is still pretty similar to how phones are used, except they also double as point-and-shoot cameras.

A shift is thus occurring in the whole definition of personal computing and the place of general purpose computers in society going forward. My "real" computer is at this point used almost entirely for particular purposes that require local computational power -- either photo and video editing or programming -- and I noticed when I first got a smartphone that I ended up spending a lot less time sitting at my desk aimlessly browsing the web after checking my email, because I no longer sat down at my desk to check my email at all.

This is pretty cool, but at the same time it also means that a lot more people who use computers will not necessarily be able to tinker and understand how they work, because these devices are usually more locked down than a full-blown machine where it's easy enough to install your own OS or software from anywhere. This is good for security and reliability but I do worry about the obfuscation of underlying mechanisms and the propagation of the sense that technology really is magic.

From my perspective as a developer and as an artist who is interested in incorporating computers into my practice, the cloud is both a tremendous tool and a fascinating subject in and of itself.
