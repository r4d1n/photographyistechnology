Amazon is a high profile company that a lot of people shop from, which faces criticism (from critical folks, for its labor politics (though not as much as Uber). This was highlighted most recently in a New York Times piece about the experiences of some white collar employees in Seattle, though by all accounts working in the warehouse is pretty brutal.
But as far as I can tell, most people who don't work in technology or otherwise follow business are that aware of AWS, the company's cloud-computing infrastructure, which ([according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)) was productized as a source of additional revenue after it was built initially to support Amazon's retail operations.
Apparently (again, skimming the Wikipedia) customers include not only Pinterest and Netflix, but also NASA and the CIA.

One of my coworkers who is a big fan of AWS likes to say that it makes you into a one person army. The platform and its many services are actually kind of amazing and enable individuals and small groups to do incredible things (of course, so long as those things require on-demand computing power or bottomless, highly available storage).

So this week when I had the opportunity to attend a training session at the Amazon Web Services "Pop Up Loft" in San Francisco, I was eager to attend both for technical reasons and because the company is an intriguing agent in the unfolding present day.
I have purchased a wide variety of goods from Amazon, but the company runs no physical store. The closest thing there is to going "to" Amazon, aside from infiltrating an office, would be browsing to their website. I was curious to see what this space would be like, and excited to learn how to make use of the cloud.
