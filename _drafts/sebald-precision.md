<blockquote>
"Again and again, from front to back and from back to front, I leafed through the album that afternoon, and since then I have returned to it time and again, because, looking at the pictures, in it, it truly seemed to me, and still does, as if the dead were coming back, or as if we were on the point of joining them."
</blockquote>

The above quote is from <em>The Emigrants</em> by W.G. Sebald, a novel that I've been reading about several German Jewish Emigrants which includes photographs interspersed throughout its narrative. The story itself is divided into four parts, each pertaining to a particular individual whom the narrator either meets or learns about secondhand. Comprehensive biographies are laid out for us but the tragedy of the Holocaust--the characters all lose something, be it family, their homes, or their jobs--looms large.

Photographs are included at various points throughout the book. Not on every page, but on more than a few. Sometimes they are directly referenced in the text: their origin is told to us, they are described, the circumstances of their capture are elucidated, the narrator gives his opinion of them or tells us how they make him feel. Other times there is no commentary, only the photo or a group of photos that add to the story in a less defined way.
