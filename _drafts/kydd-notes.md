Specific mention of Apple display, video of Jobs at wwdc 2004

"Ontological paradox" of removing stasis from photo

"Gambit", and experiment. Duration as a parameter, photo is not just a measure of time. 

Also trying to avoid narrative of film

Now less Apple...Digital signage industry used in airports and malls

Deleuze, Time Image. A direct presentation of time. Not a clear measure or segment of time. Non narrative, atonal, moodless. Izumi, Antonioni. 

George Baker 2005 essay 

Screens: images are autonomous 

Last piece: heal brush 

Notes how possibilities of video come from use of a computer 

Recent work is like commercial video. Similar to ads in malls, airports. Samsung apparently big arts support, workshops for artists. 

Screens become obsolete. The work is data. Can it have another physical form?

Proliferation of web video means 16x9 isn't so prevalent.
