Made in the voice of reportage with the photojournalist's DSLR, the images in *Disco Night Sept 11*, a book of photographs and writing by Peter Van Agtmael, offer a vivid perspective of the war whose straightforward aesthetic contributes to a. This selection is broader than just those images that might appear in newspapers.

As a group, Van Agtmael's pictures depict a more holistic view of soldiers' experiences, along with glimpses of the impact of war on others, including the photographer himself. In his thoroughness, Van Agtmael is able to respectfully record pain and question its circumstances without being overtly political. His eyes are empathetic but they are still wide open.

The images are accompanied by short texts, between one sentence and one page long. Most are written by the photographer, but there are also some (particularly interesting) excerpts from interviews. Many are in the first person, which somehow makes them feel more real than if they had been in the detached language of news.

The pictures in this book are difficult to look away from or forget, and the written passages are simply wrenching. They describe the war and the consequences faced by American participants (most of whom are quite young) and their families. They also paint an especially bleak picture with regard to the effect of the United States' actions on the nations that were invaded after 9/11.

Van Agtmael seems to seek, if not good a reason for this suffering, then a keen record of it that implores we ourselves ask why? What was this all for?
