The many photographs are by turns stunning, gruesome, banal, and sad. They are made in the voice of straightforward reportage, the photojournalist's DSLR. This is a vivid but poetic perspective of the war. This selection is broader than just those images that might appear in newspapers. There are a number of pictures of military bathroom graffiti. There are many images that depict veterans away from the war, as well as mourning families of the dead. By seeking to portray a more holistic view of the soldiers' experience, Van Agtmael is able to respectfully question the wars, as well as tropes of warrior culture that can sometimes dominate coverage of combat. 

The images are accompanied by short texts, between one sentence and one page long. Most are written by the photographer, but there are also some (particularly interesting) excerpts from interviews. 

The pictures in this book are difficult to look away from or forget, and the words alongside them are equally wrenching.
